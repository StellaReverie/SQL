In this SQL code, I queried a database that's holding Marvel character data to answer questions about the characters.

#1. Who is the tallest Marvel character?
SELECT name, MAX(height_m) 
FROM marvels;

#2. What is the average height of all of the characters?
SELECT AVG(height_m) 
FROM marvels; 

#3. Which characters are taller than 1.80 meters?
SELECT name, height_m 
FROM marvels 
WHERE height_m >= 1.80;

#4. Which characters identify as female and are taller than 1.80 meters?
SELECT name, height_m 
FROM marvels 
WHERE height_m >= 1.80 
AND gender = "Female"; 

#5. How many Marvel characters identify as male and how many identify as female?
SELECT gender, COUNT(*) AS quantity 
FROM marvels 
GROUP BY gender; 

#6. Which characters are male and use their powers for good?
SELECT name 
FROM marvels 
WHERE gender = "Male" 
AND alignment = "Good"; 

#7. Which characters are not from the United States? 
SELECT name, hometown 
FROM marvels 
WHERE hometown NOT IN ("USA");

#8. What countries are the Marvel characters from? 
SELECT COUNT(*), hometown
FROM marvels
GROUP BY hometown
HAVING COUNT(*)
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;

#9. Which characters are the top candidates to join our team?
SELECT name, intelligence, alignment,
CASE
    WHEN intelligence > 5 AND alignment="Good" THEN "Top candidate"
    WHEN intelligence > 5 AND alignment= "Bad" THEN "Not a good candidate"
    WHEN intelligence < 5 AND alignment="Good" THEN "Promising candidate"
    WHEN intelligence < 5 AND alignment="BAD" THEN "Poor candidate"
    ELSE "Possible candidate"
END AS prospects
FROM marvels;
